# Medical X-ray Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

## Problem Statement
Medical X-ray image classification is a crucial task in the field of healthcare, enabling automated diagnosis of various diseases. This project focuses on classifying X-ray images to detect pneumonia using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

## Model Performance
The trained CNN model achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 95.42% on the training data and 93.11% on the test data. Such high accuracy indicates the robustness and reliability of the model in accurately identifying pneumonia cases from X-ray images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). It consists of a comprehensive collection of X-ray images categorized into pneumonia and normal classes. The dataset has been uploaded as a zip file in the main branch of this repository.

## Installation
To run the model on your system, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pydot

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras pydot

## Note
This repository represents a partial upload of the project. The complete project includes the deployment of the trained model as a live web application. Stay tuned for updates on the full project release.
